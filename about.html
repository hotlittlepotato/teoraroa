                <p>Kumu Moe’s formal training began at the age of 8 under the tutelage of Alicia Smith. Years later, she continued her training under the late Kumu Hula Aloha Dalire. It would be under Kumu Aloha that Kumu Moe would learn about Ha’aha’a (being humble) through hula.  Kumu Aloha inspired and motivated Kumu Moe to realize that hula is her life. In 1989, Kumu Moe relocated to California and in 1994, she decided to take on the challenge of teaching hula. As with hula, Kumu Moe’s classes had humble beginnings and what began with five haumana (students) has increasingly grown since. </p>
                <p>Kumu Moe has continued her hula endeavors and as the saying goes:  ‘A’ohe pau ka ‘ike I ka Halau Ho’okahi --- All hula is not taught in one Halau.  In 2012, Kumu Moe completed formal training (Uniki) under legendary singer/songwriter Hula Master Loea Frank Kawaikapuokalani Hewett.  During this time, hula was always in the mind of Kumu Moe but to her Loea she accredits bringing it back to her heart.</p>
                <p>Hula opened Kumu Moe up and created a desire within her to expand her knowledge of Tahitian dance and culture.  Kumu Moe was again fortunate to be taken under the wing of the legendary creator of the Auhuroa, the late Roiti Sylva. From 2000 until her passing, Aunty Roiti shared and taught volumes of dance movements that expressed the gracefulness and beauty of the dances and people of Tahiti.</p>

            <p>Kumu Moe has traveled worldwide, sharing her knowledge of Polynesian dances and teaching her haumana the techniques that she was taught. She firmly rooted in the strong foundation and traditions of her past.  Because of the influence of family, Kumu Aloha, Aunty Roiti, Loea Hewett, and numerous others who have blessed her by sharing their knowledge Halau Keolaloa Kuikanani ~ Teoraroa ‘Ote’a is what it is today and ready for the future. Everyone who has touched the life of Kumu Moe has added strength to her sense of “Aloha” hula spirit that she instills in her dances today.</p>
